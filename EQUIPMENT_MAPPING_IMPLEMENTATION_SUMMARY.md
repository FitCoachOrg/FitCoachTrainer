# Equipment Mapping Implementation Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED: Complete Equipment Coverage Implementation

### **🎯 What Was Implemented:**

#### **1. Added Missing Equipment Mappings:**

| **UI Option (user input)** | **Canonical Tokens (planner)** | **Special Behavior** | **Status** |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|------------|
| `barbell` | `["barbell","bench"]` | Includes bench as accessory | ✅ **ADDED** |
| `resistance_bands` | `["bands"]` | Banded exercises | ✅ **ADDED** |
| `kettlebells` | `["kettlebell"]` | Kettlebell exercises | ✅ **ADDED** |
| `cardio_machines` | `["cardio_machine","machine","bike","rower","treadmill","elliptical","stair"]` | **Injects Conditioning/Cardio focus** | ✅ **ADDED** |
| `yoga_mat` | `["bodyweight","stability ball"]` | Proxy for floor/core work | ✅ **ADDED** |

#### **2. Updated Existing Equipment Mappings:**

| **Equipment** | **Before** | **After** | **Status** |
|---------------|------------|-----------|------------|
| `bodyweight` | ✅ `["bodyweight"]` | ✅ `["bodyweight"]` | ✅ **UNCHANGED** |
| `dumbbells` | ✅ `["dumbbell"]` | ✅ `["dumbbell"]` | ✅ **UNCHANGED** |
| `full_gym` | ✅ Full mapping | ✅ Full mapping | ✅ **UNCHANGED** |

### **🔧 Technical Implementation:**

#### **1. Equipment Mapping Structure:**
```typescript
private static readonly EQUIPMENT_MAPPING = {
  "bodyweight": ["bodyweight"],
  "dumbbells": ["dumbbell"],
  "barbell": ["barbell", "bench"], // Includes bench as accessory for barbell moves
  "resistance_bands": ["bands"],
  "kettlebells": ["kettlebell"],
  "cardio_machines": ["cardio_machine", "machine", "bike", "rower", "treadmill", "elliptical", "stair"],
  "yoga_mat": ["bodyweight", "stability ball"], // Proxy for floor/core work
  "full_gym": ["barbell", "dumbbell", "cable", "machine", "bench", "kettlebell", "bands", "bodyweight", "cardio_machine"]
};
```

#### **2. Special Equipment Handling:**

##### **Cardio Machines - Automatic Conditioning Focus:**
```typescript
// Special handling for cardio machines - inject Conditioning/Cardio focus
const hasCardioMachines = eqUI.some((item: any) => 
  item?.trim() === "cardio_machines" || 
  availableEquipment.some(eq => 
    ["cardio_machine", "bike", "rower", "treadmill", "elliptical", "stair"].includes(eq)
  )
);

// Inject Conditioning/Cardio focus if cardio machines are available
if (hasCardioMachines && !targetMuscles.includes("Cardio")) {
  targetMuscles.push("Cardio");
  console.log('🏃‍♂️ Injected Conditioning/Cardio focus due to cardio machines availability');
}
```

##### **Updated Focus Mapping:**
```typescript
private static readonly FOCUS_MAPPING = {
  "upper_body": ["Chest", "Back", "Shoulders", "Arms"],
  "lower_body": ["Quads", "Glutes", "Hamstrings", "Calves"],
  "core": ["Core", "Lower Back", "Obliques"],
  "full_body": ["Full Body", "Core"],
  "cardio": ["Cardio", "Full Body"], // Updated to include Cardio as primary focus
  "flexibility": ["Core", "Lower Back"]
};
```

### **📊 Complete Equipment Coverage Table:**

| **UI Option (user input)** | **Canonical Tokens (planner)** | **Exercise Types** | **Special Features** |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| `bodyweight` | `["bodyweight"]` | Push-ups, planks, air squats, burpees | No equipment required |
| `dumbbells` | `["dumbbell"]` | Dumbbell presses, rows, squats, lunges | Versatile and scalable |
| `barbell` | `["barbell","bench"]` | Deadlifts, squats, bench press | Includes bench accessory |
| `resistance_bands` | `["bands"]` | Banded squats, rows, presses, lateral walks | Portable and versatile |
| `kettlebells` | `["kettlebell"]` | Swings, snatches, carries, Turkish get-ups | Dynamic movements |
| `cardio_machines` | `["cardio_machine","machine","bike","rower","treadmill","elliptical","stair"]` | Treadmill, bike, rower, elliptical workouts | **Auto-injects Conditioning/Cardio focus** |
| `yoga_mat` | `["bodyweight","stability ball"]` | Floor-based core work, stability exercises | Proxy for floor/core work |
| `full_gym` | `["barbell","dumbbell","cable","machine","bench","kettlebell","bands","bodyweight","cardio_machine"]` | Complete exercise library | Full access to all equipment |

### **🎯 Special Equipment Behaviors:**

#### **1. Cardio Machines - Automatic Conditioning Focus**
- **Detection**: Automatically detects cardio machine equipment
- **Action**: Injects "Cardio" focus area into target muscles
- **Result**: Ensures at least one Conditioning/Cardio block in workout plans
- **Logging**: Console logs when Conditioning/Cardio focus is injected

#### **2. Barbell - Bench Accessory Inclusion**
- **Logic**: Barbell equipment includes bench as accessory
- **Reason**: Many barbell exercises require a bench (bench press, seated overhead press)
- **Implementation**: Maps `barbell` to `["barbell","bench"]`

#### **3. Yoga Mat - Floor/Core Work Proxy**
- **Logic**: Yoga mat serves as proxy for floor-based and core-focused workouts
- **Mapping**: Maps to `["bodyweight","stability ball"]`
- **Purpose**: Enables floor-based exercises without requiring actual "mat" equipment

### **🧪 Testing Results:**

#### **Equipment Mapping Test:**
```
📦 Testing equipment: "barbell"
   → Mapped to: ["barbell", "bench"]
   🏋️‍♂️ Barbell + bench: barbell=true, bench=true

📦 Testing equipment: "cardio_machines"
   → Mapped to: ["cardio_machine", "machine", "bike", "rower", "treadmill", "elliptical", "stair"]
   🏃‍♂️ Cardio machine detection: ✅ DETECTED

📦 Testing equipment: "yoga_mat"
   → Mapped to: ["bodyweight", "stability ball"]
   🧘‍♀️ Yoga mat proxy: bodyweight=true, stability_ball=true
```

#### **Equipment Parsing Logic Test:**
```
📋 Test client equipment: ["cardio_machines", "dumbbells"]
   → Parsed equipment tokens: ["cardio_machine", "machine", "bike", "rower", "treadmill", "elliptical", "stair", "dumbbell"]
   🏃‍♂️ Cardio machine detection: ✅ DETECTED
   📝 Should inject Conditioning/Cardio focus
```
