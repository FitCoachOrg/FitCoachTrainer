# Fitness Score Implementation Plan

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for the Fitness Score system, a goal-aware scoring mechanism that tracks client progress across multiple health and fitness factors.

## **CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS**

### **✅ Existing Data Sources**
1. **`client` table** - Basic client info, goals, demographics
2. **`external_device_connect` table** - Steps, heart rate, calories, exercise time
3. **`activity_info` table** - Weight, sleep, hydration, energy levels
4. **`schedule` table** - Workout adherence tracking
5. **`workout_info` table** - Exercise completion data
6. **`meal_info` table** - Nutrition tracking (if exists)

### **❌ Missing Data Sources for Fitness Score Components**
1. **Body Metrics**: BMI, Body Fat %, Waist-to-Hip Ratio, Lean Mass %
2. **Sleep Quality**: Subjective sleep quality ratings
3. **HRV (Heart Rate Variability)**: Recovery metrics
4. **Mobility/Functional Movement**: Coach-graded assessments
5. **Balance/Stability**: Assessment scores
6. **Nutrition Details**: Protein, carbs, fats intake tracking
7. **Emotional/Lifestyle**: Mood, stress, alcohol, screen time, caffeine

  - Integration with wearable devices

## **DATA SOURCES & INTEGRATION**

### **Primary Data Sources**
1. **Manual Entry** - Client self-reported data via forms
2. **External Devices** - Wearable device integration (steps, HR, HRV)
3. **Coach Assessments** - Trainer-graded mobility and balance scores
4. **Existing System Data** - Workout adherence, nutrition logs

### **Data Flow Architecture**
```
Client Input → Data Validation → Storage → Weekly Aggregation → Score Calculation → Display
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
Forms/Devices → Validation Rules → Supabase → Fitness Score Service → UI Components
```

## **SCORING ALGORITHMS**

### **Goal-Aware Weighting System**
Each factor has different weights based on the client's goal category:

| Factor | Fat Loss | Muscle Gain | Wellness | Performance |
|--------|----------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| BMI | 7 | 3 | 5 | 2 |
| Weight Trend | 8 | 5 | 3 | 3 |
| Body Fat % | 7 | 8 | 5 | 5 |
| Sleep Hours | 5 | 6 | 8 | 6 |
| Exercise Adherence | 10 | 10 | 6 | 10 |
| Protein Intake | 8 | 10 | 5 | 8 |

### **Scoring Logic Examples**
1. **BMI Scoring**: Full score (100) if 18.5-24.9, linear penalty outside range
2. **Weight Trend**: Goal-specific targets (fat loss: -0.5% to -1%/week)
3. **Sleep Quality**: 1-10 scale converted to 0-100 score
4. **Exercise Adherence**: Percentage-based with bonus for >90%

## **USER EXPERIENCE FLOW**

### **Initial Setup**
1. Client selects goal category (Fat Loss, Muscle Gain, Wellness, Performance)
2. System automatically selects relevant factors based on goal
3. Client can customize factor selection and weights
4. Configuration is saved and used for weekly calculations

### **Daily Data Entry**
1. Client accesses data entry forms via dashboard
2. Enters daily metrics across 5 categories:
   - Body Metrics (weight, body fat, measurements)
   - Sleep & Recovery (hours, quality, HRV)
   - Hydration & Activity (water, steps, mobility)
   - Nutrition (calories, macros, logging)
   - Emotional & Lifestyle (mood, stress, habits)

### **Weekly Score Generation**
1. System aggregates 7 days of data
2. Calculates individual factor scores
3. Applies goal-specific weights
4. Generates overall fitness score (0-100)
5. Stores score in history for trend analysis

### **Progress Tracking**
1. Weekly score history visualization
2. Factor-specific breakdown and insights
3. Goal achievement probability calculations
4. Personalized recommendations based on score trends
