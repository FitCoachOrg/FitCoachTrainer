# Test Your Cron Job Setup

## üß™ Multiple Testing Methods

Here are several ways to verify your cron job is working correctly:

## Method 1: Check Cron Job Status in Supabase Dashboard

### Step 1: View Cron Jobs
1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to Database** ‚Üí **Cron Jobs**
3. **Look for your cron job** `daily-engagement-score-calculation`
4. **Check the status** - it should show as "Active"

### Step 2: Check Execution History
1. **Click on your cron job**
2. **View the "Execution History" tab**
3. **Look for recent executions**
4. **Check for any error messages**

## Method 2: Test Function Manually

### Step 1: Get Your Service Role Key
```bash
# Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API
# Copy your service_role key (starts with eyJ...)
```

### Step 2: Test with curl
```bash
curl -X POST https://zyozeuihjptarceuipwu.supabase.co/functions/v1/calculate_engagement_score_improved \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Step 3: Check Response
**Expected Success Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "Engagement scores calculated and stored for previous day.",
  "date": "2024-01-15",
  "duration": "12.34 seconds",
  "processed": 23,
  "skipped": 2,
  "errors": 0,
  "total_clients": 25,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-16T01:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**If you get an error, check:**
- Service role key is correct
- Function is deployed
- Environment variables are set

## Method 3: Check Database for New Entries

### Step 1: Check Recent Engagement Scores
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT 
  client_id,
  for_date,
  eng_score,
  total_due,
  completed,
  created_at
FROM client_engagement_score 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

### Step 2: Check for Today's Entries
```sql
-- Check if scores were calculated for today
SELECT COUNT(*) as today_count
FROM client_engagement_score 
WHERE for_date = CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day';
```

## Method 4: Monitor Function Logs

### Step 1: View Function Logs
1. **Go to Edge Functions** in Supabase Dashboard
2. **Click on** `calculate_engagement_score_improved`
3. **Check the logs** for recent executions

### Step 2: Look for These Log Messages
```
üöÄ Starting daily engagement score calculation...
üìÖ Calculating engagement scores for date: 2024-01-15
üë• Found 25 active clients
‚úÖ John Doe: 80% (4/5 tasks completed)
üìä Daily Engagement Score Calculation Summary:
‚è±Ô∏è  Duration: 12.34 seconds
‚úÖ Processed: 23 clients
‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipped: 2 clients (already calculated)
‚ùå Errors: 0 clients
```

## Method 5: Test Cron Job Trigger Manually

### Step 1: Temporarily Change Schedule
1. **Go to Database** ‚Üí **Cron Jobs**
2. **Edit your cron job**
3. **Change schedule to run in 2 minutes:**
   ```sql
   -- Example: Run at current time + 2 minutes
   SELECT cron.schedule(
     'daily-engagement-score-calculation',
     '*/2 * * * *',  -- Every 2 minutes (for testing)
     'SELECT net.http_post(
       url := ''https://zyozeuihjptarceuipwu.supabase.co/functions/v1/calculate_engagement_score_improved'',
       headers := ''{"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY", "Content-Type": "application/json"}''
     );'
   );
   ```

### Step 2: Monitor Execution
1. **Wait 2-3 minutes**
2. **Check execution history**
3. **View function logs**
4. **Check database for new entries**

### Step 3: Reset to Daily Schedule
```sql
-- Change back to daily at 1:00 AM
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'daily-engagement-score-calculation',
  '0 1 * * *',  -- Daily at 1:00 AM UTC
  'SELECT net.http_post(
    url := ''https://zyozeuihjptarceuipwu.supabase.co/functions/v1/calculate_engagement_score_improved'',
    headers := ''{"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY", "Content-Type": "application/json"}''
  );'
);
```

## Method 6: Check Frontend Integration

### Step 1: Start Your App
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Check Client Dashboard
1. **Open your app in browser**
2. **Go to Clients page**
3. **Look for engagement scores**
4. **Check if scores are displaying**

## üîç Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 2: Function Returning Errors
**Check:**
