# Workout Plan LLM Prompt Improvements

## Summary of Enhancements

The workout plan LLM prompt has been significantly improved with better token optimization and enhanced personalization features.

## Token Optimization Results

| Metric | Original Prompt | Enhanced Prompt | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Characters** | 4,030 | 1,722 | **57% reduction** |
| **Words** | 896 | 312 | **65% reduction** |
| **Estimated Tokens** | ~1,008 | 431 | **57% reduction** |

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Enhanced Client Data Processing**

#### **BMI Calculation & Weight Status**
```typescript
// New: Automatic BMI calculation and weight status detection
const bmi = calculateBMI(clientInfo.height, clientInfo.weight);
const isOverweight = bmi && parseFloat(bmi) > 25;
const isUnderweight = bmi && parseFloat(bmi) < 18.5;
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic exercise intensity adjustments
- Weight-specific training recommendations
- Health-aware exercise selection

### 2. **Intelligent Injury Processing**

#### **Original Approach:**
```
Limitations/Injuries: Knee injury
Back pain
```

#### **Enhanced Approach:**
```typescript
// New: Intelligent injury analysis with specific adaptations
const injuryAnalysis = processInjuries(clientInfo.injuriesLimitations);
// Results in:
// Injuries: Low-impact alternatives for knee exercises; Core-focused, avoid heavy deadlifts initially
// Avoid: heavy squats, lunges, jumping, deep knee bends, heavy deadlifts, overhead press, bent-over rows
```

**Benefits:**
- Specific exercise adaptations
- Clear forbidden exercises list
- Injury-aware training parameters

### 3. **Goal-Specific Training Parameters**

#### **Dynamic Training Parameter Calculation:**
```typescript
const trainingParams = getTrainingParams(clientInfo.primaryGoal, clientInfo.trainingExperience);
// For client 34 (build_muscle + beginner):
// Reps: 8-12 | Sets: 2-3 | Rest: 90-120s | Focus: hypertrophy | Intensity: moderate
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic rep/set/rest period calculation
- Experience-level adjustments
- Goal-specific training focus

### 4. **Streamlined Prompt Structure**

#### **Original Structure:**
```
