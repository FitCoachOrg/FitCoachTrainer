## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { CoachTipGenerator } from './coach-tip';

const exercise = {
  exercise_name: 'Deadlift',
  category: 'Strength',
  body_part: 'Full Body',
  equipment: 'Barbell',
  experience_level: 'Intermediate',
  primary_muscle: 'Lower Back'
};

const context = {
  goal: 'strength',
  phase: 1,
  experience: 'Intermediate',
  injuries: [],
  progression: null
};

const coachTip = CoachTipGenerator.generateCoachTip(exercise, context);
console.log(coachTip);
// Output: "RPE 7.5, 3-1-3 tempo, Keep chest up throughout the movement, Push through your heels, Barbell exercise"
```

### Simple Usage (Backward Compatibility)

```typescript
import { CoachTipGenerator } from './coach-tip';

const exercise = {
  exercise_name: 'Push-up',
  equipment: 'Bodyweight',
  experience_level: 'Beginner'
};

const coachTip = CoachTipGenerator.generateSimpleCoachTip(exercise, 'fat_loss');
console.log(coachTip);
// Output: "RPE 6.5-7.5, 1-0-1 tempo, Keep your body in a straight line, Lower your chest to the ground, No equipment needed"
```

## 📊 RPE Calculation

The system calculates RPE based on:

### Goal-Based RPE Ranges

| Goal | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 | Phase 4 |
|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Fat Loss** | RPE 7-8 | RPE 7.5-8 | RPE 8 | RPE 6-7 |
| **Hypertrophy** | RPE 7-8 | RPE 7.5-8 | RPE 8 | RPE 6-7 |
| **Strength** | RPE 7 | RPE 8 | RPE 8.5 | RPE 6-7 |
| **Endurance** | RPE 6-7 | RPE 6.5-7.5 | RPE 7-8 | RPE 5-6 |
| **Power** | RPE 8-9 | RPE 8.5-9 | RPE 9 | RPE 7-8 |

### Exercise Modifiers

- **Compound movements** (deadlift, squat, bench press): +0.5 RPE
- **Isolation movements** (curls, extensions): -0.5 RPE
- **Conditioning exercises** (burpees, mountain climbers): -1.0 RPE

### Experience Modifiers

- **Beginner**: -0.5 RPE (focus on form)
- **Intermediate**: 0 RPE (standard)
- **Advanced**: +0.5 RPE (can handle higher intensity)

## ⏱️ Tempo Recommendations

### Goal-Based Tempo

| Goal | Compound | Isolation |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Strength** | 3-1-3 | 2-1-2 |
| **Hypertrophy** | 3-1-2 | 2-1-2 |
| **Endurance** | 2-1-2 | 2-1-2 |
| **Fat Loss** | 2-1-2 | 2-1-2 |
| **Power** | 1-0-1 | 2-0-1 |

### Exercise-Specific Adjustments

- **Bodyweight exercises** (push-ups, pull-ups): 1-0-1 or 2-0-1
- **Explosive movements** (cleans, snatches): 1-0-1
- **Isometric holds** (planks, wall sits): "hold"

## 💪 Form Cues Database

The system includes exercise-specific form cues for:

### Compound Movements
- **Deadlift**: "Keep chest up", "Push through heels", "Keep bar close to shins"
- **Squat**: "Knees track over toes", "Keep chest up", "Push through full foot"
- **Bench Press**: "Retract scapula", "Keep feet flat", "Control the descent"

### Isolation Movements
- **Curls**: "Keep elbows at sides", "Control the movement", "Don't swing"
- **Push-ups**: "Keep body straight", "Lower chest to ground", "Engage core"

### Movement Pattern Fallbacks
- **Hinge**: "Hinge at the hips, not the waist", "Keep your back straight"
- **Squat**: "Knees track over toes", "Keep chest up"
- **Push**: "Keep core engaged", "Full range of motion"
- **Pull**: "Engage lats", "Keep shoulders down"

## 🛠️ Equipment Notes

Equipment-specific guidance for:

- **Bodyweight**: "No equipment needed"
- **Dumbbell**: "Dumbbell exercise"
- **Barbell**: "Barbell exercise"
- **Machine**: "Machine exercise"
- **Cable**: "Cable exercise"
- **Kettlebell**: "Kettlebell exercise"

## 🔗 Integration Examples

### With Enhanced Workout Generator

```typescript
import { CoachTipGenerator, CoachTipUtils } from './coach-tip';

// Replace existing generateTrainerNotes function
const generateTrainerNotes = (exercise: any, context: any): string => {
  const normalizedExercise = CoachTipUtils.normalizeExercise(exercise);
  
  const coachTipContext = {
    goal: context.goal || 'fat_loss',
    phase: context.phase || 1,
    experience: context.experience || 'Beginner',
    injuries: context.injuries || [],
    progression: context.progression
  };
  
  return CoachTipGenerator.generateCoachTip(normalizedExercise, coachTipContext);
};
```

### With Search-Based Workout Plan

```typescript
// Replace existing coach_tip generation
const generateCoachTipForSearchBased = (exercise: any, clientGoal: string, clientExperience: string, clientInjuries: any[]) => {
  const normalizedExercise = CoachTipUtils.normalizeExercise(exercise);
  
  const coachTipContext = {
    goal: clientGoal || 'fat_loss',
    phase: 1,
    experience: clientExperience || 'Beginner',
    injuries: clientInjuries || [],
    progression: null
  };
  
  return CoachTipGenerator.generateCoachTip(normalizedExercise, coachTipContext);
};
```

### With AI-Based System

```typescript
// Enhance AI-generated coach tips
const enhanceAICoachTip = (aiCoachTip: string, exercise: any, context: any) => {
  const normalizedExercise = CoachTipUtils.normalizeExercise(exercise);
  
  const coachTipContext = {
    goal: context.goal || 'fat_loss',
    phase: context.phase || 1,
    experience: context.experience || 'Intermediate',
    injuries: context.injuries || [],
    progression: context.progression
  };
  
  const structuredTip = CoachTipGenerator.generateCoachTip(normalizedExercise, coachTipContext);
  
  return `${structuredTip} | ${aiCoachTip}`;
};
```
