# Monthly Plan Generation Test for Client ID 34

## Test Steps:
1. Open browser console (F12 â†’ Console)
2. Navigate to client with ID 34
3. Switch to Monthly view
4. Click 'Monthly SearchBased Plan'
5. Monitor console logs during generation
6. Check Supabase schedule_preview table after completion

## Expected Console Logs:
- ðŸš€ MonthlyPlanGenerator: Generating Week 1 for Client 34
- ï¿½ï¿½ Week 1 Progression Status: [progression data]
- âœ… MonthlyPlanGenerator: Week 1 saved successfully to schedule_preview
- [Repeat for Weeks 2-4 with increasing progression]

## Database Query to Verify:
SELECT * FROM schedule_preview 
WHERE client_id = 34 
AND type = 'workout' 
AND created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY for_date DESC;

## Look for progressive loading evidence:
1. Increasing sets/reps across weeks
2. Progression_applied data in details_json
3. Different intensity levels between weeks
4. Exercise variety with intensity progression
