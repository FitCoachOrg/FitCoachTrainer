# Step 6: Verify Integration with Your App

## Test the Frontend Integration

### 1. Start Your Development Server

```bash
# Navigate to your client directory
cd client

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Check the Clients Page

1. **Open your browser** and go to your app
2. **Navigate to the Clients page** (usually `/clients`)
3. **Look for engagement scores** - they should appear as:
   - Percentage values (e.g., "80%")
   - Color-coded indicators (green for high, yellow for medium, red for low)
   - 1-day, 7-day, and 30-day metrics

### 3. Check Individual Client Profiles

1. **Click on a client** to view their detailed profile
2. **Look for engagement metrics** in the client dashboard
3. **Verify the scores match** what you calculated in the previous steps

## Test the API Integration

### 1. Test the Client-Side Function

Open your browser's developer console and run:

```javascript
// Test the engagement score function
import { getOrCreateEngagementScore } from './src/lib/client-engagement';

// Replace with a real client ID
const clientId = 1;
const score = await getOrCreateEngagementScore(clientId);
console.log('Engagement Score:', score);
```

### 2. Check Database Entries

In your Supabase Dashboard:

1. **Go to Table Editor**
2. **Select `client_engagement_score`**
3. **Verify you see entries** with:
   - `client_id`: The client ID
   - `for_date`: The date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
   - `eng_score`: Percentage (0-100)
   - `total_due`: Number of tasks due
   - `completed`: Number of completed tasks

## Verify Data Flow

### 1. Check the Data Pipeline

The engagement score data flows through these components:

1. **Database**: `schedule` table â†’ `client_engagement_score` table
2. **Backend**: Daily automation script calculates scores
3. **Frontend**: Client-side function fetches and displays scores
4. **UI**: Engagement scores displayed in client dashboard

### 2. Test the Complete Flow

1. **Create a test task** for a client in the schedule table
2. **Mark it as completed** in your app
3. **Run the automation script** manually:
   ```bash
   node daily-engagement-score-calculator.mjs
   ```
4. **Check the client dashboard** - the engagement score should update

## Troubleshooting Integration Issues

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Scores Not Displaying

**Check:**
- Database connection in your app
- Client-side function is being called
- Environment variables are set correctly

**Debug:**
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log('Testing engagement score...');
const score = await getOrCreateEngagementScore(1);
console.log('Score:', score);
```

#### 2. Scores Not Updating

**Check:**
- Automation script is running daily
- Database has recent entries
- Frontend is fetching latest data

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check recent logs
tail -f engagement-scores.log

# Check database entries
# In Supabase SQL Editor:
SELECT * FROM client_engagement_score 
ORDER BY for_date DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

#### 3. Incorrect Scores

**Check:**
- Schedule table has correct data
- Task status is properly set
- Date calculations are correct

**Debug:**
```sql
-- Check schedule data for a specific client and date
SELECT * FROM schedule 
WHERE client_id = 1 
AND for_date = '2024-01-15';
```

## Performance Testing

### 1. Test with Multiple Clients

1. **Create multiple test clients** if you don't have many
2. **Add schedule entries** for different dates
3. **Run the automation script**
4. **Verify all clients** show engagement scores

### 2. Test Date Range Calculations

1. **Run the script for a date range**:
   ```bash
   node daily-engagement-score-calculator.mjs --date-range 2024-01-01,2024-01-31
   ```
2. **Check the database** for multiple entries
3. **Verify the frontend** displays historical data correctly

## Final Verification Checklist

- âœ… **Database**: `client_engagement_score` table exists and has data
- âœ… **Automation**: Daily script runs without errors
- âœ… **Frontend**: Engagement scores display in client dashboard
- âœ… **Accuracy**: Scores match expected calculations
- âœ… **Performance**: App loads quickly with engagement data
- âœ… **Logging**: Automation logs show successful runs

## Success Indicators

You'll know the integration is working when:

1. **Daily automation** runs successfully and logs show no errors
2. **Client dashboard** displays engagement scores for all clients
3. **Scores update** when tasks are completed
4. **Historical data** shows trends over time
5. **Performance** remains good with the additional data

## Next Steps

Once integration is verified:

1. **Monitor the system** for a week to ensure stability
2. **Set up alerts** if you want notifications for failures
3. **Optimize performance** if needed
4. **Document any customizations** you made

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the logs** first for error details
2. **Verify database connectivity** and permissions
3. **Test individual components** to isolate the issue
4. **Review the documentation** for troubleshooting tips
